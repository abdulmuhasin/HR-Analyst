# HR-Analyst<br>
This project will involve building a machine learning model to predict employee turnover, also known as employee attrition, using Python. The code will use common libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, model building, and visualization.<br>
<B>Human Resources Machine Learning Project: Predicting Employee Turnover</B><br>
<B>Objective : </B><br>
The HR analyst project is  to predict whether an employees turnover (attrition) based on various  features such as age, job satisfaction, salary, Position, Department, Termination Reason, Performance Score, Recrutment Source.<br>
We are uses different steps for cleaning, renasmning, removing unwanted columns, columns extra datas, outliers<br>
After all this we build a model using random forest and the model perform well it shows  the model predicted 100% of the test data correctly. All predictions matched the actual attrition status.
